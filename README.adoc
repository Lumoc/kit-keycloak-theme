= A simple kit to edit your Keycloak theme

image::./keycloak-dev.gif[]

== Usage

You need docker and docker-compose.
In your shell, run:

```
docker-compose up
```

It will start a Postgres database and a Keycloak container.
A volume will be setup on the themes directory.

Now you can build your theme in the directory
```
./themes/mytheme
```

NOTE: if you want to change the name `mytheme` by something else, you will have to edit the `docker-compose.yml` file too (`KEYCLOAK_WELCOME_THEME` and `KEYCLOAK_DEFAULT_THEME`).
